							<b>Objective</b><br><br>
							One important thing that architects must think about when making plans is how long the buildings will last. Designers and builders try to make buildings that are good for the earth when they are putting them together. These things are made possible by using eco-friendly technology and materials. This helps them have less of an effect on the world and use less energy. To make houses as eco-friendly as possible, things like solar panels, systems that collect rainwater, and materials that keep the building warm are needed.
							Making sure the people who will be living in the building are safe and secure is another important goal of architectural planning. This is an important goal because it has to do with how the building is designed. Installing safety features like smoke alarms, fire doors, and security systems is part of this process. The goal is to protect against possible risks by offering protection. In order to make sure that everyone lives safely, the planners have to think about a lot of different things. Some of these factors are setting up emergency evacuation paths and making sure that people with disabilities can get to the area.
